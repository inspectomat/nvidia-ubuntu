# Unit test for the selected code block
# File: test_ubuntu_optimization.sh

# Test case 1: Should work with different versions of CUDA Toolkit
# Install different versions of CUDA Toolkit
sudo apt install -y nvidia-cuda-toolkit-12.1
sudo apt install -y nvidia-cuda-toolkit-11.8

# Check if the selected code block works with different CUDA Toolkit versions
# Run the selected code block with different CUDA Toolkit versions
# Example:
# ./ubuntu_optimization.sh
# nvidia-smi
# Check if the code block successfully installs and configures the NVIDIA drivers
# and optimizes the system for different CUDA Toolkit versions

# Additional test cases can be added as needed
# Example:
# Test case 2: Check if the selected code block works with different NVIDIA driver versions
# Install different versions of NVIDIA driver
# sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-545
# sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-540

# Check if the selected code block works with different NVIDIA driver versions
# Run the selected code block with different NVIDIA driver versions
# Example:
# ./ubuntu_optimization.sh
# nvidia-smi
# Check if the code block successfully installs and configures the NVIDIA drivers
# and optimizes the system for different NVIDIA driver versions
